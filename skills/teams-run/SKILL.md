# Teams: Run (Resume Build)

You are the orchestrator. Resume an existing build by running all incomplete phases, then reviewing and applying fixes.

---

## Step 1: Find the Plan

List all files matching `.ralph-teams/PLAN-*.md`. If none exist:
> No plan files found in `.ralph-teams/`. Use `/teams-plan` to create a plan first.

If multiple plan files exist, show the list and ask the user which plan to resume. Default to the highest-numbered plan.

Read the selected plan file (e.g. `.ralph-teams/PLAN-2.md`). Store the filename as `PLAN_FILE`.

Identify:
- Plan ID (the `Plan ID:` field — e.g. `#2`)
- All phases, their status (`[x]` = done, `[!]` = failed, `[ ]` = incomplete), their complexity annotation (`complexity: simple` or `complexity: standard`), and any `parallel-group` annotations
- Platform (web or mobile)
- Verification scenarios

Print the current state:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  RALPH-TEAMS Plan #[N] — Resuming — [N of M phases already done]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  ✓  Phase 1: Project Setup          [done]
  ✓  Phase 2: Auth System            [done]
  ○  Phase 3: API Routes             [pending]
  ○  Phase 4: Frontend               [pending]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

---

## Step 1.5: Choose Execution Mode

Check whether any incomplete phases have a `parallel-group` annotation.

**If none do:** set `EXEC_MODE = sequential` automatically — skip this step entirely.

**If at least one incomplete phase has `parallel-group`:** ask the user:

> **"Would you like to run remaining phases in parallel or sequential mode?**
> - **Sequential** (default): phases run one at a time in order — safer, easier to debug
> - **Parallel**: independent phase groups run simultaneously — faster
>
> The plan has [M] incomplete phase(s) marked for parallel execution. Reply `parallel` or `sequential`."

Save the answer as `EXEC_MODE` (`parallel` or `sequential`).

---

## Step 2: Execute — Builder Subagents

Capture the base commit SHA before building starts:
```bash
git rev-parse HEAD
```
Save this as `BASE_SHA`.

**Group incomplete phases into execution batches:**
- Phases without `parallel-group` → each is its own batch (always sequential)
- Phases sharing the same `parallel-group` label → form one batch
- Batches execute in the order the first phase of each batch appears in the plan
- Skip already-completed phases (`[x]`)

Pick the model from the phase's complexity annotation:
- `complexity: simple` → `model: "haiku"`
- `complexity: standard` → `model: "sonnet"`

**For each batch, execute as follows:**

**If `EXEC_MODE = sequential` OR batch has only 1 phase:**

Spawn one builder at a time and wait for completion:

```
Agent(
  subagent_type: "teams:teams-builder",
  model: "[haiku | sonnet based on phase complexity]",
  prompt: "You are implementing Phase [N] of [M]: [phase description].

    Tasks to complete:
    [list tasks from the phase]

    Platform: [web|mobile]

    Plan file: [PLAN_FILE] — read this file for full context, acceptance criteria, and verification scenarios.

    Your assignment: implement Phase [N] only, completing all its tasks. Verify it works using [Playwright|Maestro], then commit.
    If [Playwright|Maestro] tools are not available, run tests/lint instead and note that E2E verification was skipped."
)
```

**If `EXEC_MODE = parallel` AND batch has 2+ phases:**

Spawn all phases in the batch simultaneously using `run_in_background: true`, then wait for all to complete before proceeding:

```
# Spawn all phases in the batch at the same time:
Agent(
  subagent_type: "teams:teams-builder",
  model: "[haiku | sonnet]",
  run_in_background: true,
  name: "builder-phase-[N]",
  prompt: "You are implementing Phase [N] of [M] (running in parallel with Phase [N2]): [phase description].

    Tasks to complete:
    [list tasks]

    Platform: [web|mobile]

    Plan file: [PLAN_FILE] — read this file for full context, acceptance criteria, and verification scenarios.

    IMPORTANT: You are running in parallel with other builders. Only modify files for your specific phase.
    Do not modify shared config files, package.json, or files touched by parallel phases.
    Your assignment: implement Phase [N] only. Verify it works, then commit with message: 'feat: [phase name]'."
)

# ... spawn all other phases in the batch with run_in_background: true ...

# Then wait for all background agents in this batch to complete before moving to the next batch.
```

After each batch completes, update `[PLAN_FILE]` (change `[ ]` to `[x]` on success, `[!]` on failure for each phase) and reprint the phase board:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  RALPH-TEAMS  [N of M phases complete]  [SEQUENTIAL | PARALLEL]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  ✓  Phase 1: Project Setup          [done]        (haiku)
  ►  Phase 2: Auth System            [building...] (sonnet) ┐ parallel-group A
  ►  Phase 3: DB Schema              [building...] (haiku)  ┘
  ○  Phase 4: API Routes             [pending]     (sonnet)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

If a builder subagent fails, log it as failed and continue with the next batch.

---

## Step 3: Opus Review

After all phases complete, print:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  RALPH-TEAMS  Reviewing implementation...
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

Spawn the reviewer:

```
Agent(
  subagent_type: "teams:teams-reviewer",
  model: "opus",
  prompt: "Review the implementation for: [feature name].

    Base commit (before build started): [BASE_SHA]
    Use `git diff [BASE_SHA]..HEAD` to see all changes.

    Plan file: [PLAN_FILE] — read this file for phases, acceptance criteria, and verification scenarios.

    Append your review to [PLAN_FILE] as a '## Review' section."
)
```

---

## Step 4: Apply Fixes

Read the `## Review` section from `[PLAN_FILE]`. If there are **blocking findings** (issues the reviewer escalated — not ones already marked `[fixed by reviewer]`):
1. Print a summary of the findings.
2. Spawn a fix-pass builder:
   ```
   Agent(
     subagent_type: "teams:teams-builder",
     model: "sonnet",
     prompt: "You are applying review fixes (not implementing a new phase).

       Review findings to fix (from '## Review' section of .ralph-teams/PLAN.md):
       [paste blocking findings]

       Platform: [web|mobile]

       Fix each blocking issue. Verify the fixes work using [Playwright|Maestro].
       If verification tools are not available, run tests/lint instead.
       Commit all fixes together with message: 'fix: address review findings'."
   )
   ```
3. After the fix-pass builder completes, append a fix summary to `[PLAN_FILE]`:
   ```markdown
   ---

   ## Review Fixes Applied

   Fixes: [brief description of what was changed]
   Commit: fix: address review findings
   Status: All blocking findings resolved
   ```
   Also update the `## Review` section in the plan to mark any blocking findings as `Resolved` inline.

Final summary:
```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  RALPH-TEAMS  Plan #[N] — Build complete!
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  ✓  Phase 1: ...
  ✓  Phase 2: ...
  ✓  Review: [passed | N fixes applied]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

Then suggest:
> **Build done. Run `/teams-verify` to walk through manual E2E verification.**

---

## Step 5: Optional — Update Docs

Ask the user:

> **"Would you like to update your documentation? Run `/teams-document` to have the scribe update your README, ARCHITECTURE.md, and other docs."**

If yes, invoke the `teams-document` skill.

If **no**, skip.
