# ralph-teams

A Claude Code plugin that plans and builds features using sequential Sonnet builder subagents, automated E2E verification, and an Opus code review pass.

## Quick Start

```
/teams:plan
```

That's it. Describe what you want to build — Claude handles the rest.

## Quick Install

**1. Add the plugin to `~/.claude/settings.json`:**

```json
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "ralph-teams-claude-plugin": {
      "source": {
        "source": "github",
        "repo": "tuansondinh/ralph-teams-claude-plugin"
      }
    }
  },
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "@ralph-teams-claude-plugin": true
  }
}
```

**2. Restart Claude Code.**

**3. Run `/teams:plan` in any project.**

## How it works

```
/teams:plan   →  Discuss feature → write plan → approve
/teams:run    →  Build each task (one fresh Sonnet agent per task)
              →  Opus reviewer checks the full implementation
              →  Builder applies any blocking fixes
/teams:verify →  Walk through E2E scenarios manually with you
```

Each task runs in its own isolated subagent with a clean context window. Results are committed after each task so you can always resume with `/teams:run`.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/teams:plan` | Discuss → plan → optional AI review → approve → build → Opus review → fixes |
| `/teams:run` | Resume an existing plan from where it left off |
| `/teams:verify` | Walk through manual E2E verification scenario by scenario |
| `/teams:loop-plan` | Plan and build a large feature in sequential phases |
| `/teams:loop-run` | Resume a phased plan |
